      Neuroplasticity can be viewed as a general umbrella term that refers to the brain&apos;s ability to modify, change, and
      adapt both structure and function throughout life and in response to experience
    </p>
    <p>
      Our brains are a lot like computers. We collect inputs, make calculations, then respond with outputs. Part of what
      makes our brains different, however, is their power to change biological composition. This process of adaptation
      is called neuroplasticity, and it&apos;s something we should all know a little more about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity occurs most heavily during infancy and adolescence, but even as adults our brains are constantly
      rewiring themselves based on challenges and habits. The reason you were able to learn multiplication tables, for
      instance, is because your brain physically created neural pathways over time to make this process easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> So why bring this up alongside programming?</strong> Because many believe that it is a skill reserved for
      the computer savvy geek archetype and that&apos;s simply not true. There&apos;s a massive learning curve, and getting over
      that hump takes a tremendous amount of time, patience, and support.
