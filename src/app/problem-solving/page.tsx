        Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first
        understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to
        translate this &quot;algorithm&quot; into something a computer can do,
        and finally how to &quot;write&quot; the specific syntax (required by a
        computer) to get the job done.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, developers need to find a problem they can solve with software.
        Then, they have to figure out how humans solve that problem. And then,
        they have to find a way to effectively translate both the problem and
        well as (or better than) a person.
