    <h2>Weeks 1-5</h2>
    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <p>
      People use GitHub to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you&apos;re visualizing data or
      building a new game, there&apos;s a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can help you do it even better.
      GitHub Skills&apos; ‚ÄúIntroduction to GitHub‚Äù course guides you through everything you need to start contributing in
      less
      than an hour.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    <p>
      HTML is the foundation of all web pages. It defines the structure of a page, while CSS defines its style. HTML and
      CSS are the beginning of everything you need to know to make your first web page! Learn both and start creating
      amazing websites.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 3</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript is among the most powerful and flexible programming languages of the web. It powers the dynamic
      behavior
      on most websites, including this one.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 4</h3>
    <p>
      Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a
      procedure‚Äîa set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a
      function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the
      input
      and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 5</h3>
    <p>
      Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string
      interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates.
      
      Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string
      interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may
      not
      result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the
      different parts of the template literal.

      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          <em>I already know myself so &apos;learnt&apos; will mean &ap&apos;os;become apparent again&apos;</em> I&apos;m;
          <li>Indipendent</li>
          <li>Spontanious / sabotage</li>
          <li>Can reset my by mind with offtasks surprisingly</li>
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Well I value the code, im self-aware of the code and I need empathy around people working on the code üòÖ
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Knowing that other people must&apos;ve had similar feelings through there programming learning journey is dopey.
          Also
          understanding the feeling of programming compared to learning other study <em>eg math</em>
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          <em>Let me change the word <strong>core</strong> into <strong>people-skills</strong> so the question makes
            sense
            to me... </em> 
          I&apos;ve found it challenging understanding what is meant by core && what im meant to do with core üò© && why I
          would
          invest a lot of time for not much with core when
          I&apos;m doing better learning how to code üòÑ
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
        development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          It&apos;s very important to have people-skills for a job. <em>(ie: anyone thats not a people-person is fucked
            !!!)</em>
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
        time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Developing people skills for me is slow yet I&apos;m making more gains on learning programming üòÑ. Ive spent my
          whole
          life developing people skills so they&apos;re not really going to change much in 5 weeks
        </p>
      </ul>
